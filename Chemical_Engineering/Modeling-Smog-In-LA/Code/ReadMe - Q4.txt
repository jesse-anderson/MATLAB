As v0 is varied the slope of the average increase in CO accumulation changes. When v0 is at its lowest CO has a steep slope. At a very high v0 of 1.67e+13 the CO levels off.
====
As a is varied the y axis difference increases somewhat or the intercept. That is, the final amount of CO changes with the different values of a proportionally.
=====
As b is varied the amplitude of the variation or curviness of the function changes. b multiplies the sin function directly so it will change the amplitude of the sinusoidal function directly.
